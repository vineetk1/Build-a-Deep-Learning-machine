# Pick hardware components
Register for an account on PC-Part-Picker at https://pcpartpicker.com/. This site is invaluable for building a system. It lists prices of components from various vendors, detects incompatibilities among selected components, keeps track of wattage the components will consume, and a lot more.  

Following is a list of components and their prices:   
$ &thinsp; 250 &emsp; &emsp; i5-8400 CPU and Motherboard   
$ &thinsp; 525 &emsp; &emsp; GeForce GTX 1080 8GB GPU   
$ &thinsp; 294 &emsp; &emsp; 32GB (2 x 16GB) DDR4-2400 RAM   
$ &thinsp; 200 &emsp; &emsp; 500GB NVMe PCIe M.2 2280 SSD   
$ &ensp; 56 &emsp; &emsp; Fully-Modular ATX Power Supply   
$ &ensp; 40 &emsp; &emsp; ATX Mid Tower Case   
&emsp; &emsp; &emsp;  &emsp; &thinsp;  Monitor   
&emsp; &emsp; &emsp;  &emsp; &thinsp;  Keyboard   
&emsp; &emsp; &emsp;  &emsp; &thinsp;  Mouse   
$1365 &emsp; &emsp; Total including rebates, sales tax, and shipping; but excluding Monitor, Keyboard, and Mouse  
Include a hard drive if 500 GB of SSD capacity is not sufficient. My specific components list is at <https://pcpartpicker.com/user/vink9482/saved/M6WxYJ>.   
# Assemble hardware components
Spend sufficient time in understanding the instructions in the installation manuals that come with each component. Carefully follow directions in the installation manuals to install the components. I installed the components in the following order:   
1. Install the CPU in the Motherboard.
1. Install the Fan on the CPU. The i5-8400 CPU comes with a Fan.
1. Install the Power Supply in the Case.
1. Install the Motherboard in the Case. 
1. Install the SSD in the Motherboard.
1. Install the RAM in the Motherboard.
1. Install the GPU in the Motherboard.
2. Turn ON the power.
The assembly should be hassle-free, unless one or more components are faulty.
