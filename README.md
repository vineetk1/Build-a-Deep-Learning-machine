# Pick hardware components
Register for an account on PC-Part-Picker at https://pcpartpicker.com/. This site is invaluable for building a system. It lists prices of components from various vendors, detects incompatibilities among picked components, and a lot more.  
My parts list is at <https://pcpartpicker.com/user/vink9482/saved/M6WxYJ>. Following is a list of my price (including rebates, sales tax, shipping, etc.) on each component:   
* $250    i5-8400 CPU and Motherboard
