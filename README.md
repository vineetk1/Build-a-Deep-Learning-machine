# Pick hardware components
Register for an account at <a href="https://pcpartpicker.com" target="_blank">PC Part Picker</a>. This site is invaluable for building a system. It lists prices of components from various vendors, detects incompatibilities among selected components, keeps track of wattage the components will consume, and a lot more.  

Following is my list of components and their prices:   
$ &thinsp; 250 &emsp; &emsp; i5-8400 CPU and Motherboard   
$ &thinsp; 525 &emsp; &emsp; GeForce GTX 1080 8GB GPU   
$ &thinsp; 294 &emsp; &emsp; 32GB (2 x 16GB) DDR4-2400 RAM   
$ &thinsp; 200 &emsp; &emsp; 500GB NVMe PCIe M.2 2280 SSD   
$ &ensp; 56 &emsp; &emsp; Fully-Modular ATX Power Supply   
$ &ensp; 40 &emsp; &emsp; ATX Mid Tower Case   
&emsp; &emsp; &emsp;  &emsp; &thinsp;  Monitor   
&emsp; &emsp; &emsp;  &emsp; &thinsp;  Keyboard   
&emsp; &emsp; &emsp;  &emsp; &thinsp;  Mouse   
&emsp; &emsp; &emsp;  &emsp; &thinsp;  USB drive   
$1365 &emsp; &emsp; Total including rebates, sales tax, and shipping; but excluding Monitor, Keyboard, and Mouse  

I already have a cheap monitor, a USB drive, and a wired USB keyboard and mouse that I will use to boot the system and install the Secure Shell (SSH). Thereafter, I should have no need for these accessories (i.e. monitor, keyboard, mouse, USB) because I will use my laptop to log into this system via my home network (and also the Internet) using SSH.   
My specific components list is <a href="https://pcpartpicker.com/user/vink9482/saved/M6WxYJ" target="_blank">HERE</a>. Add a hard drive if 500 GB of SSD capacity is insufficient.
# Assemble hardware components
Spend sufficient time in understanding the instructions in the installation manuals and the videos that come with the components. Carefully follow directions in the installation manuals and the videos to install the components. I installed the components in the following order:   
1. Install the CPU in the Motherboard.
1. Install the Fan on the CPU. The i5-8400 CPU comes with a Fan.
1. Install the Power Supply in the Case.
1. Install the Motherboard in the Case. 
1. Install the SSD in the Motherboard.
1. Install the RAM in the Motherboard.
1. Install the GPU in the Motherboard.
1. Turn ON the power.
The assembly should be hassle-free, unless one or more components are faulty.
# Boot the system 
## &emsp; &emsp; Create a bootable USB stick for the OS
I will use the Ubuntu OS. As of this writing, Ubuntu Desktop 18.04 is the stable and latest version. This tutorial on <a href="https://tutorials.ubuntu.com/tutorial/tutorial-create-a-usb-stick-on-ubuntu#0" target="_blank">creating a bootable USB stick</a> makes the process very simple.
## &emsp; &emsp; Install OS in the hardware system
# Install other software
## &emsp; &emsp; Install SSH
## &emsp; &emsp; Install Deep Learning software
